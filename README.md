## Release instructions

While on development branch, look at tags with `git tag` .

`npm version minor` will bump the version up. If that doesn't work due to the version existing, simply repeat the command and that should bump the version to the correct one in package.json.

`git push --follow-tags` will push the changes and the tags that have been created.

To get the release on github, create a PR and compare the master and development branches to one another, naming it "Release 0.[x].0".

In case of conflict, stay on development branch and do `git merge master`. Most likely most conflicts that need to be resolved will be a case of accepting the incoming changes.

- `git add [file]`

- `git commit -m "Solve merge conflict with master"`

- `git push`

Merge after approval

**Do NOT delete the branch after merging!**

On the repository homepage go to: "releases" -> "Draft a new release" -> select the latest tag -> name "0.[x].0"

Proceed to publish
